# Getting Started with HTML/CSS Project

This project is built using basic HTML and CSS.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can perform the following tasks:

### `open index.html`

Opens the main HTML file in your default web browser.  
Use this to view your project directly without the need for a server.

### `Live Server (Optional)`

If you're using VS Code, you can install the **Live Server** extension.  
This allows automatic reloading when you make changes to `HTML` or `CSS`.

To start:
- Right-click `index.html`
- Choose **"Open with Live Server"**

### `npm install -g live-server` (Optional)

Install **Live Server** globally via npm if you want to use it from the command line.

Then run:
```bash
live-server
This will serve your project at http://localhost:8080 (or another available port).
